# ⚙️Working Principle

The AI-Enhanced IoT Cradle Monitoring System continuously monitors the infant’s safety and surrounding environmental conditions using multiple sensors connected to the ESP32 microcontroller. The temperature, humidity, sound, and wetness sensors collect real-time data from the cradle environment. A webcam captures live video of the infant, and the YOLOv8-based machine learning model analyzes the video feed to detect unsafe sleeping positions or unusual movements. Based on the sensor readings, the system automatically controls the cradle swinging mechanism using a servo motor and regulates the fan through a relay module whenever the temperature exceeds the predefined limit. In critical situations such as abnormal temperature, excessive crying, or unsafe sleeping posture, instant alert notifications are sent to parents through a Telegram bot, enabling remote monitoring and immediate response for improved infant safety.
